* Python scripts

# Step by step guide
The following procedures are supposed to run in the Bastion node.

## 1.Precheck

## 2.Install tools and libs
* yum install -y python27
* ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python
* python -m pip install configparser
* yum install jq

## 3. Create the log directory
mkdir -p /ibm/logs

## 4.Prepare node settings

### Load balancer timeout settings
As the load balancer have several options and sometimes it's not available to operate them directly, so the manual work is still needed.

### Prepare the Node setting templates
**CRI-O container settings**<br/>
On Red Hat OpenShift version 4.5/4.6, Machine Config Pools manage your cluster of nodes and their corresponding Machine Configs (machineconfig). To change a setting in the crio.conf file, you can create a new machineconfig containing only the crio.conf file.

copy the crio.conf settings from a worker node by running the scp command from the worker node. Run this command from a terminal within the cluster network to make sure that you do not override an existing manual configuration. <br/>
`scp core@$(oc get nodes | grep worker | head -1 | awk '{print $1}'):/etc/crio/crio.conf /tmp/crio.conf`

Verify that /tmp/crio.conf looks like the template https://github.com/IBM/luban/blob/main/cpdauto/scripts/templates/cpd/crio.conf. If not, edit or add the following entries about **default_ulimits** and **pids_limit** in the **[crio.runtime]** section of the /tmp/crio.conf file.

`sed -i 's/pids_limit.*/pids_limit = 12290\ndefault_ulimits = [\n\ \ \ \ "nofile=66560:66560"\n]/g' /tmp/crio.conf`

After the verification passed, move the `/tmp/crio.conf` file to the folder `**cpdauto/scripts/templates/cpd/**`.

## 5.Configure your installation
Please refer to the template cpd_install.conf and update accordingly.
https://github.com/IBM/luban/blob/main/cpdauto/cpd_install.conf

## 6.Launch the installation
`cd ./cpdauto/scripts`<br/>
`chmod +x ./bootstrap.sh`<br/>
`nohup ./bootstrap.sh &`

## 7.Monitor the installation
### Overview
Check the log file overall_log_file that you specified in cpd_install.conf. <br/>
Or run the following command:
`watch -n 10 "tail -n 10 nohup.out"`
### Details
There will be logs corresponding to the push, apply and install commands for each assembly.
`ls /ibm/logs/`
Check the log for details.

## 8.Validate the installation status
### Check the installed assembly's status
`cpd-linux status -n yournamespace`

## 9.Troubleshooting
If the auto installation failed, you can do the troubleshooting as follows.
### 1)Check the logs as mentioned in Step 7
### 2)Check the logs of cpd-install-operator
`oc logs $(oc get po | grep cpd-install-operator | awk '{print }')`
### 3)Check if some pods failed to start up during the installation
`oc get po --no-headers --all-namespaces -o wide| grep -Ev '([[:digit:]])/\1.*R' | grep -v 'Completed'`
### 4)Switch to the manual installation
If the auto installation keeps failing, then there maybe something wrong with the environment and it's better handle the installation manually.
